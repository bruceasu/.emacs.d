;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Some enhanced functions for buffer manipulate.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put buffer-extension.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'buffer-extension)
;;
;; No need more.

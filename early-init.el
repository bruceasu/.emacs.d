;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.
;;

;;; Code:

;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum
      gc-cons-percentage 0.6)

;; In Emacs 27+, package initialization occurs before `user-init-file' is
;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. Doom handles package initialization, so
;; we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
;; Do not allow loading from the package cache (same reason).
(setq package-quickstart nil)

;; Prevent the glimpse of un-styled Emacs by disabling these UI elements early.
(push '(menu-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(tool-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(vertical-scroll-bars) default-frame-alist)

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we easily halve startup times with fonts that are
;; larger than the system default.
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

;; Disable GUI elements
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
(setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
(setq use-file-dialog nil)

;; Prevent unwanted runtime builds in gccemacs (native-comp); packages are
;; compiled ahead-of-time when they are installed and site files are compiled
;; when gccemacs is installed.
(setq comp-deferred-compilation nil)

;;; custom.el --- user customization file    -*- no-byte-compile: t -*-
;;; Commentary:
;;;       Copy custom-template.el to custom.el and change the configurations, then restart Emacs.
;;;       Put your own configurations in custom-post.el to override default configurations.
;;; Code:

;; (setq suk-full-name "user name")           ; User full name
;; (setq suk-mail-address "user@email.com")   ; Email address
;; (setq suk-proxy "127.0.0.1:1080")          ; Network proxy
;; (setq suk-package-archives 'emacs-china)   ; Package repo: melpa, melpa-mirror, emacs-china netease or tuna
;; (setq suk-cnfonts t)                       ; Use cnfonts not: t or nil


;; Misc.
;; (setq confirm-kill-emacs 'y-or-n-p)

 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.

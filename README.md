This is an Emacs distribution that aims to enhance the default
Emacs experience. It alters a lot of the default settings,
bundles a plethora of additional packages and adds its own core
library to the mix. The final product offers an easy to use Emacs
configuration for Emacs newcomers and lots of additional power for
Emacs power users.

It's able to run on Windows, GNU Linux and macOS. It is compatible **ONLY with
GNU Emacs 25.1 and above**. In general you're advised to always run with the
latest stable release - currently **26.1**.
